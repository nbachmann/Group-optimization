# Group-optimization
An integer program that finds optimal groups for a class project. Gets data from surveys via an excel file. Then, optimizes group compositions based on skills and times available to meet. Places students in groups that best match their project preference. Gurobi was used to create and optimize the model and Pandas was used to extract, clean and organize the data which was sourced from an excel workbook.
